# Drag and Drop H265 Compression
Requires FFMPEG and uses hevc_nvenc (Nvidia GPU Hardware acceleration)

Drag any media over the batch file to start compressing. Quick and easy ffmpeg batch script to compress any media over a defined bitrate by a defined amount to H265. Uses only the first video and audio stream.

A lot of improvements are to be made, for now it's just a quick and easy solution for conveniences sake.
